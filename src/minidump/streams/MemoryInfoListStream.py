Any indirect call to locations in those pages will fail CFG checks and the process will be terminated. The default behavior for executable pages allocated is to be marked valid call targets for CFG.

For example, if the pages in the region was allocated using PAGE_TARGETS_INVALID, then the invalid information will be maintained while the page protection changes. This flag is only valid when the protection changes to an executable type like PAGE_EXECUTE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE and PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY. The default behavior for VirtualProtect protection change to executable is to mark all locations as valid call targets for CFG.

	#When an access attempt leads the system to turn off guard page status, the underlying page protection takes over.
	#If a guard page exception occurs during a system service, the service typically returns a failure status indicator.

	#This flag is not supported by the CreateFileMapping function.

	PAGE_NOCACHE = 0x200

	#The PAGE_NOCACHE flag cannot be used with the PAGE_GUARD, PAGE_NOACCESS, or PAGE_WRITECOMBINE flags.
	#The PAGE_NOCACHE flag can be used only when allocating private memory with the VirtualAlloc, VirtualAllocEx, or VirtualAllocExNuma functions. To enable non-cached memory access for shared memory, specify the SEC_NOCACHE flag when calling the CreateFileMapping function.
	PAGE_WRITECOMBINE = 0x400 #Sets all pages to be write-combined.
	#Applications should not use this attribute except when explicitly required for a device. Using the interlocked functions with memory that is mapped as write-combined can result in an EXCEPTION_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION exception.
	#The PAGE_WRITECOMBINE flag cannot be specified with the PAGE_NOACCESS, PAGE_GUARD, and PAGE_NOCACHE flags.
	#The PAGE_WRITECOMBINE flag can be used only when allocating private memory with the VirtualAlloc, VirtualAllocEx, or VirtualAllocExNuma functions. To enable write-combined memory access for shared memory, specify the SEC_WRITECOMBINE flag when calling the CreateFileMapping function.
